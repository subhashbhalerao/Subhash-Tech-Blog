Hello Everyone,

Here I am going to start documenting my tech skills in IT.
I have been working in IT field for around 20 years. 

I have been working from MS-Dos to Windows 11 operating systems, Intel 486 processor based systems to Intel i7. I have been working in IT system administration and IT education filelds. 

I always like to learn on the new IT technologies, actually I can say it's my hobby.
I don't get bored at learning new things and I enjoys it.

Here, I want to start a series of tutorials covering Linux technology, System Administration, Web Programming, DevOps practices and Cloud Technology etc.

Hope you will enjoys looking into these tutorials.

Thanks

Subhash Bhalerao
